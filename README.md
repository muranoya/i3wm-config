# i3wm-config
This is my i3wm config for Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th.

I am using ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6th with HDR WQHD IPS display and I installed Ubuntu Desktop 19.10 to it.

Basically I added actions for special function keys to i3wm config which is installed by `apt` and changed mod key to `ALT`.

I refer to this git repository(Thank you so much). https://github.com/alberto-santini/i3-configuration-x1
